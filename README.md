Vulnerability management is the cyclical practice of identifying, classifying, prioritizing, remediating, and mitigating software vulnerabilities.
Basically Vulnerability management is continuously assessing your assets discovering vulnerabilities remediating them to an acceptable risk and then kind starting the process again and again, over and over to make sure the whole organization is low or at least acceptable level of risk.
